# GameOne

First Mini RPG in python; wasn't exactly intending to build a game, but one thing led to another.. and here I am.
There is currently no interface available, game is played entirely in the terminal, but maybe I'll manage to build something in the future for it as I learn JS.

After realizing how easy this would be to scale to crazy levels I had to stop as the focus is not currently on game development.

#To do:
Improve code, ceck and add comments where necesary.
